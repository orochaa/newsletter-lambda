## ðŸ§ª How to Test

You can test the endpoints using:

### âœ… Option 1: HTTP Request Templates

This project includes a test.http file in the root directory. You can use it with VS Code and the REST Client extension to easily run and test all API endpoints.

#### Steps:

1. Install the [REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) for VS Code.
2. Open [test.http](./test.http).
3. Replace placeholders like `https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev` with your deployed URL.
4. Click `"Send Request"` above any HTTP block to run it directly.

### âœ… Option 2: curl or Postman

Example with `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev/subscribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com"}'
```
